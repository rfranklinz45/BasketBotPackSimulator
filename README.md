# BasketBotPackSimulator
Pack Simulator for Basketbot
This is pretty self explanatory. Put your pack type (1 , 2, 3, 4, 5) in the top box and the number of packs in the bottom box.
Then just hit the button.

VERSION 2 NOTES:
-Shard return for COMMON and UNCOMMON pulls is back! You'll also get an expected shards amount.
-The price of your pack opening is now displayed in the sim button.
-Streamlined simulation so it can run about 10million packs every 5 seconds on a decent machine.

CHAMPION EDITION:
-accounts for different champion pack weight. Name reflected in pack results.
